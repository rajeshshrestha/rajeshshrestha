### Hi there, this is Rajesh 👋.
Thanks for checking my page. I'm a passionate Machine Learning Engineer 👨🏻‍💻 and am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree🎓 in Computer Science at Oregon State University, Corvallis.
Interested in the field of machine learning and deep learning, specifically in generative modeling and representation learning. Want to work in the intersection area of machine learning, mathematics and optimization.

Posses strong mathematical background and years of industry experience. Have knowledge and understanding from broad area of machine learning: reinforcement learning, generative models, probabilistic graphical model, deep learning etc.  Worked in various domains including computer vision, recommendation systems, data systems and communication systems.



Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the effective and efficient recovery of channel information with the use of machine learning and optimization along with their theoretical analysis.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on solving problems involving generative models and representation learning.
